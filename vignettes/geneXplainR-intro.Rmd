# Introduction

The geneXplainR package provides an R client for the 
[geneXplain platform](http://genexplain.com/genexplain-platform/) [1]. 
The geneXplain platform is an online toolbox and workflow management 
system for a broad range of bioinformatic and systems biology applications.
The platform is well-known for its upstream analysis [2], that has been
developed to identify causal signalling molecules on the basis of experimental data
like expression measurements.

geneXplainR is based on and extends the [rbiouml](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbiouml/index.html) package.
A goal of this project is to add functionality that helps to make building R pipelines that use the geneXplain platform easier.
