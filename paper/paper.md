## Summary

The geneXplain platform [@genexplain] is an online toolbox and workflow management
system for a broad range of bioinformatic and systems biology applications. The 
platform is well-known for its upstream analysis [@upstreamAnalysis], that has 
been developed to identify causal signalling molecules on the basis of experimental
data like expression measurements. An important feature of the toolbox is the
possibility to define and execute workflows that can implement sequential and
parallel multi-step analysis processes. Figure 1 shows the graphical user interface of
the platform with an example workflow.
